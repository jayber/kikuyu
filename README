==================

Installation
#############

Pre-requisites

1. Install grails on your machine
You will need to install grails 2.2.1, and set this project up in IntelliJ as a grails project:
http://grails.org
Use grails 'add-proxy' and 'set-proxy' commands. Note, that proxy server should not have protocol provided:
 'cache2.practicallaw.com'.

2. Install MongoDB on your machine and your dev env
You will also need to install mongodb server:
http://www.mongodb.org/
Follow the instructions for installing and testing mongodb.
When installing in your dev env, note that port must be unique, so avoid using default port.
You can specify the port with additional argument '--port [port]' in shell script.

4. Install Gradle on your machine
http://www.gradle.org/

5. Configure dynamic data in application
 *mongo-datasource.properties

Running locally
###############
Use 'run-app' command from grails console from application directory or IntelliJ grails configuration to run
the application. Default port is 8080, you can override it using -Dserver.port=[port_number] either from command line
or by adding VM option on IntelliJ configuration.

Build and deploy
################
 *  Stop the server.
 *  Execute gradle 'deploy' target for deploy which automatically invokes build as well.
    You can specify environment by providing envNo variable either from command line or gradle.properties.
    For example: 'gradle -PenvNo=37 deploy'.
 *  Start the server. You can access application by going to 'http://d[env]-infra.dev.practicallaw.com:8080/kikuyu'
